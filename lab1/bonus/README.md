Firstly, I observed that the main diagonal of the matrix mush be bordered by 1 and then, it remains that the last element of the first line must also be 1, 
because in a cycle graph all the vertices have grade 2. We also know that the matrix is symmetric. Or, if I look at the lines, the second one is the opposite of the first, the third is the opposite of the second and so on. 
I populated the matrix and then I made two methods, one for multiplying two matrices, and the other to find A powered 2,3,4,...,n, using the first method created.
